# Advent of Code 2025 in Rust

Runner code comes from the excellent https://github.com/timvisee/advent-of-code-2024

```batch
# Switch to day 1a, add input, and run it
cd day01a
cargo run --release

# or run everything in parallel
cd ../runner
cargo run --release --bin runner-par

# or benchmark every day
cd ../runner
cargo run --release --bin bench
```
